# Core Features

## Polymorphism in Subtypes


## Template-Oriented
We may be pretty impressive on some features about template programming in C++ and have racked ourselves on meta-programming that it offers. Hence Descript further facilitates the template system, implementing a more elegant way to do typing with templates.

## Markup Instantiation
We could use JSX or TSX in a font-end framework, which integrates scripts with markup-styled language used to instance classes. Descript naturalizes and refines this feature in class Instantiation.
